There is a clear opportunity to improve the world by creating products that empower and enrich their users, disrupting systems that create economic and social inequality. We think that rapid, iterative improvements in production techniques, collaborative technologies, and intellectual property management are not only possible but within reach and that we have a duty to reach for it. We want to see a future where diffuse global wealth is the norm, and we're building the tools necessary to take the next step towards that future.
